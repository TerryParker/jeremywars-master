## How to Compile the Code

In the project directory, you can run:

### `1.npm install`

Once the repository is on your computer the first thing to do is within the terminal do npm install. This will allow for the two commands next (node & yarn) to be able to be executed within the directoy.

### `2. node server.js`

This will start up the Node(Express) server that is connecting to the SWAPI. This will set up the server on port 3001.

### `3. yarn start`

Do this in a separate Terminal then the one use for the server!!!!
